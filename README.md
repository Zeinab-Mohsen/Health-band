# Health Band

This project was for the IOT course.

**This project does:**

1- Read the heart rate and blood oxygen level by using the MAX30102 EGC Oximeter sensor.

2- Measure the temperature and humidity of the room using a DHT11 sensor.

3- If the sensor reads a reading outside the normal range the ESP sends an email to the person specified and sends the reading to Google sheet.

4- The ESP is connected to the Blynk app to have real-time reading on the mobile app.

5- The readings are displayed on the LCD screen all the time.
